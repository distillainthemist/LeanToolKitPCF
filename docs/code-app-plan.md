# The board app as a Power Apps code app — plan of record

Decision (2026-07-18): the master-leanboard app is built as a **Power Apps
code app** (TypeScript + vite, deployed via `pac code`), not a canvas app.
[board-app-build.md](board-app-build.md) remains as the canvas-era
alternative and the authoritative statement of the app's *behaviour* — its
recipes translate 1:1 into the typed data layer below.

**Core principle: nothing already built is rewritten.** The 24 platform-free
editor classes (`controls/*/editor.ts`), the shared schemas, the recurrence
engine and the SVG tile pipeline import as-is. The code app replaces only
the Power Fx glue that was never built. The PCF solution keeps shipping
unchanged for drop-in reuse in other canvas/model apps (dual-target).

## Why (recap)

- The canvas glue was the riskiest part of the plan — `JSON()`/`ParseJSON`
  string round-trips, echo loops, LoadGate machinery — and it exists *only*
  because canvas talks to controls through string channels. In the app,
  screens call editor setters with objects.
- The 23-card stacked editor screen disappears: mount one editor by type.
- The data-policy recipes (shared live rows, SVG archiving, carry chains)
  become **unit-testable TypeScript** instead of `ForAll`/`Patch` formulas.
- Trade-offs accepted: code-app platform maturity (verify in Phase 0 —
  especially **Safari/WebKit** for wallboards), dev-only app changes
  (configuration stays data-driven), premium licensing (unchanged — the
  app needed Dataverse either way).

## Decisions (Ben, 2026-07-18)

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Repo shape | **Same repo**, new `app/` folder (vite + TS) importing `../shared` and `../controls/*/editor` directly |
| Framework | **Vanilla TS** — tiny hash-router + the toolkit's `el()` helpers; one paradigm end to end (React only if `pac code` tooling forces it) |
| Roster | **LTK People table** (curated roster — the project's original people decision), fed by **searching Microsoft Entra ID** via the Office 365 Users connector and *adding* people. Entra is the search source; LTK People is the operative roster carrying crew / site / department enrichment |
| Org tree | A **config row** (Site Settings-style table) holds the `orgJSON` site → department → area tree, feeding MeetingWizard and LeanHub identically |

## Phases

### Phase 0 — de-risk (cheap, first)

1. Fix `pac` on the Mac (v2.8.1 dotnet tool crashes in its auth store on
   .NET 10) — update/reinstall the tool or clear its state; fallback is
   running pac in CI or a container.
2. `pac auth create` (device-code; Ben signs in), pick the environment,
   confirm **code apps are enabled** there and the `pac code` command
   surface exists.
3. Hello-world spike: `pac code init` + vite, one Dataverse read through a
   generated typed client, `pac code push`, open in Power Apps — proves
   the auth → data → deploy loop end to end.
4. Verify the support matrix that matters here: **Safari/WebKit**
   (wallboard TVs — the foreignObject scars), mobile player if phones
   matter. Any blocker → the canvas build kit is the documented fallback.

### Phase 1 — `app/` scaffold

- vite + TS in `app/`, tsconfig paths into `../shared` and
  `../controls/*/editor`; hash-router; screen registry.
- **CardHost adapter**: what the PCF wrappers do, minus the string
  channels — instantiate the editor class into a div, call setters with
  parsed objects, wire callbacks straight to the data layer. No LoadGate,
  no resetTrigger, no settingsJSON precedence dance (stored blobs are
  still parsed with the same shared functions).
- Prove it by mounting LeanHub + one card locally with fake data.

### Phase 2 — "LeanToolKit Data" solution (schema, deployed separately)

Eight tables per [master-leanboard.md](master-leanboard.md) plus the new
roster:

- LTK Board · LTK Board Instance · LTK Card Data (incl. `ben_boardid`,
  blank-instance live rows) · LTK Card Catalog · LTK Actions additions
  (`ben_boardid`) · LTK Site Settings (protected times, org tree config) ·
  LTK User Prefs
- **LTK People** (new): whoId (Entra object id, alternate key), name,
  email, crew, site, department, active. Powers `peopleJSON` everywhere,
  crew linkage, and viewer identity (signed-in user → whoId).

Environments receive schema by solution import **before** the app deploys.
Card Catalog seeding becomes an app first-run **self-heal** from
`catalogJSON` / tile-defaults, keyed to the installed solution version.

### Phase 3 — typed data layer (`app/store/`)

`pac code add-data-source` per table (+ the Office 365 Users connector for
Entra search) generates typed models; `store/` translates every build-kit
recipe into tested TS:

- instance creation with all four policies (clear / carry-latest-by-
  datetime / **shared** live rows / link)
- SVG archive stamping at meeting close; tilesJSON join with the
  live-row and catalog fallbacks
- actions upsert by `(instanceId, id)` (+ `ben_boardid` stamping)
- prefs / protected-times persistence; board creation from the wizard
  blob (`ben_occurrencesettings`, roster from participants)
- people admin: Entra search → add to LTK People
- **vitest** over the store and the recurrence engine (finally testable).

### Phase 4 — screens

1. **Home = LeanHub** (Cadence / Actions / Settings) — chip tap →
   board screen with the scheduler's `selectIso` deep-link handshake.
2. **Board screen** — BoardGrid + left-pane MeetingScheduler (meeting
   boards), instance creation, close-meeting archive.
3. **Card editor** — registry map type → editor class, save loop
   (`outputJSON` + `svgExport` → Card Data), actions channel, nav-order
   next/previous.
4. **Composer** (CardSettings) and **Meeting wizard** (MeetingWizard).
5. **People admin** — Entra search, add/enrich roster (crew, site,
   department), deactivate.
6. Boards list / admin odds and ends.

### Phase 5 — ALM & rollout

- GitHub Actions: data-solution import → `pac code push`, matching the
  existing release rhythm.
- Pilot the bottling standup end to end (wizard → board → meeting →
  actions → hub), then broaden.
- Docs: this file + a code-app build doc as source of truth;
  board-app-build.md marked canvas-era.

## Risks / open items

- Code-app platform maturity (mobile, offline = none, ALM depth) —
  Phase 0 verifies; canvas kit is the fallback.
- `pac` on macOS — Phase 0, item 1.
- Entra search needs the Office 365 Users connector consented in the
  environment; if blocked, People admin degrades to manual entry
  (the table design is unchanged).
- Viewer identity mapping: signed-in user → LTK People row (match on
  Entra object id / email at app start; prompt to self-register if
  missing).
